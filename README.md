Hello, 
<br>
I'm David Johnson and I'm currently learning C Programming on my free time. So if you want to use my work as a reference or use the programs to teach others please do! I'll keep a list of what I've done.

1. Hello World
2. Variables
3. Strings
4. If, Else, Else If
5. Do While
6. Random Numbers
7. Random Number Seeding
8. Functions
9. Logical Operators
10. While Loop
11. Switch
12. Arrays
13. File Saving

Arrays was the last thing in the tutorial series, so I will continue with the scraps of stuff I keep learning. 

I also will be adding some practice programs.
